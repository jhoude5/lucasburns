            <h3>The Power to choose</h3>
            <p>Finding the right mortgage can be a stressful experience. With so many lenders offering so many options, choosing the right mortgage can be a difficult choice. The staff at Martel Mortgages listen carefully to ensure that their mortgage recommendations serve you not only today but well into the future.</p>
          <h2>Mortgage Renewals</h2>
          <p>It's Time to Renew. Have a Martel Mortgage Agent give you a Financial Check-up instead!

                    A renewal is like a fresh start, so don't get caught by the banks. A renewal may not be the answer! A refinance for a fresh start may be what is best.

                    When a term is coming to a close, most Canadian banks will send a mortgage renewal notice in the mail a few months before the term is up. At this time the banks tend to assume that you will sign on with them for another term at their posted rate with very little or no discount. Over half of the public will sign this renewal without researching what the competition has to offer. At Martel Mortgages we are here to offer you the expertise and resources so you can take advantage of the competitive mortgage market.

                    Renewals are easy to complete and can expand your financial options:</p>

                        <h2>Refinancing / Debt Consolidation</h2>
                        <p>Deciding to refinance a mortgage is a big financial decision and it takes more than the decrease in interest rates to urge you to avail of another loan. You must understand your options and the considerations that go with each alternative.
                    What is refinancing?
                    Refinancing your mortgage means that you will go into an agreement of a new loan to pay the existing one. This represents a new loan, with new terms and even a new lender. It has a constant interest rate which is hopefully lower than the previous one. The terms can be shorter or longer, and sometimes, the interest is low enough that the terms may not need any changes at all.
                    There are a variety of options available to help you make the right mortgage decision that could leave you with more dollars in your pocket.</p>

                    <p>Did you know you can turn your home equity into cash? A Home Equity Loan Plan allows you use your home as security to borrow up to 80% of its current value minus what you owe. This is a great option to consider if for larger purchasing or renovation needs for a vacation home.
