I would have saved even more money!</p></div>

He was always available any time we reached out. Lucas lowered our stress by explaining all the financial details. We were so happy with his knowledge and the service he provided.

                                        <div class="testimonial-grid__description"><p>When it comes to buying your first home it can be really scary.  We elected to purchase a home during the global pandemic.  This isn’t an easy decision for most as jobs, careers, futures are all up in the air right now.  We were living in a low-rise apartment building at the time and from March ‘till July there had been construction so loud from 7 am - 5 pm every day that it was time to pull a trigger.

I had worked with Lucas in a different industry before and knew what kind of character he always brought to the table.  Dependable is the important word here, there’s nothing worse than trying to purchase a very expensive item and having terrible communication.  With Lucas it was perfect communication, never a day went by when I wanted to have an update and I got it.

We started to hunt at the start of June and by July 24th we were in our new home.  Lucas also hooked us up with our Realtor who was able to narrow down the homes we were looking for.  Funny thing was that we found our home online ourselves but our Realtor was the one who gave us the great opportunity to realize it by seeing other homes first. 

With Lucas, we were able to get an amazing rate, amazing terms and there was zero pressure.  The only hard work we had to do was 2 hours of putting together the paperwork and that’s all.  The signing was digital and quick, even the meetings over the phone to explain the mortgage information and terms were quick.

Both my wife and I would like to thank Lucas again for his hard work, we both look forward to his services again when we renew in 5 years.</p></div>

While I was shopping around for brokers, Lucas was always willing to go the extra mile for me to get me the best rate he could and did a bunch of math to figure out multiple scenarios I had given him (to know how much I’d pay; biweekly, accelerated, monthly, all at different rates with a different possible downpayment amount). When I had any questions or concerns, he was right there to call or message to help me and find the answers. I chose Lucas over my bank due to his commitment to helping me throughout the whole process, and his help &amp; support still continues!</p><p>Thank you so much, Lucas!</p></div>
